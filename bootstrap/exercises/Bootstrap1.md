# Bootstrap Exercise 1

## Clone the Remote Repository

This will copy some ``bootstrap`` program files to your ``htdocs`` folder.  

Go to [this link](https://github.com/barcaxi/csd2024/tree/main) and download the repository ZIP file.  Copy the folder ``bootstrap`` into your XAMPP ``htdocs`` folder.

Check your ``htdocs`` folder.  You should have a new folder called ``bootstrap`` with some files in it.
